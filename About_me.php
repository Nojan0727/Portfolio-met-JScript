       <h1 class="main-heading">About me</h1>
       <p class="text-paragraph">I graduated in 2016 with a degree in Financial Accounting. During my studies, I volunteered as a firefighter, which taught me valuable lessons in teamwork and resilience.</p>
       <p class="text-paragraph">After completing my studies, I worked for two years at the largest non-alcoholic beverage company (Istak) in Iran, where I developed my skills in business operations and financial analysis. In 2022, I transitioned into the role of an accountant assistant, managing financial records and assisting with budget preparation. However, I realized my passion lay in technology, and I decided to transition into the IT field.</p>
       <p class="text-paragraph">Currently, I am pursuing a Software Developer program, enhancing my technical knowledge and skills in programming, website development, and IT infrastructure.</p>
